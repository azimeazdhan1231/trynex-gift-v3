# Replit Deployment Guide

## Recommended: Replit Deployments

Since your project is already on Replit, the easiest and most efficient way to deploy is using Replit's built-in deployment system.

### Steps:

1. **Open Deployments Tab**
   - Click the "Deploy" button at the top right of your workspace
   - Or open a new pane and type "Deployments"

2. **Choose Deployment Type**
   - Select "Autoscale Deployment" for full-stack applications like yours
   - This handles both frontend and backend automatically

3. **Configure Deployment**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Run Command: `npm start`
   - The system will automatically detect your package.json and install dependencies

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Set up your environment variables in the Replit Secrets tab:
     - `DATABASE_URL` - Your database connection string
     - `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"
     - Any other API keys or secrets your app needs

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy" and wait for the process to complete
   - You'll get a live URL that's automatically managed and scaled

### Benefits of Replit Deployments:
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with your current setup
- **Automatic Scaling**: Handles traffic spikes automatically
- **Free Tier**: Generous free tier for small to medium applications
- **Integrated**: No need to reconfigure your build process
- **Live Updates**: Easy to redeploy with one click

### Production Setup Commands:

Your project is already configured correctly for Replit deployments!
